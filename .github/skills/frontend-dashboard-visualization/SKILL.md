# Frontend dashboard visualization

Start with the user's analytical question and the real data shape, then choose the simplest encoding that supports an accurate decision.

## When to invoke

- "Design an operational dashboard from these real metrics."
- "Choose the right chart for this analytical question."
- "Review this KPI page for misleading or inaccessible visualization."
- "Define dashboard filters, tables, drilldowns, and failure states."
- "Test a chart-heavy frontend with realistic edge cases."

## Analytical contract

For every metric or visualization, record:

- question or decision supported;
- metric name, definition, unit, time window, comparison baseline, update time, and provenance;
- dimensions, cardinality, ordering, missingness, precision, and uncertainty;
- target audience and required scanning or exact-value behavior;
- filters, drilldowns, exports, annotations, thresholds, and access limits;
- loading, empty, delayed, partial, stale, unavailable, error, and recovery states.

Never invent a metric or use fictional production values unless the user explicitly requests labeled synthetic fixture data.

## Chart and table selection

Read [references/chart-selection.md](references/chart-selection.md). Prefer tables for exact values and operational scanning. Use charts only when position, length, area, color, or another encoding improves the stated question.

Read [references/dashboard-patterns.md](references/dashboard-patterns.md) for filter, provenance, density, and state behavior. Read [references/accessible-data-visualization.md](references/accessible-data-visualization.md) for summaries, tables, keyboard, focus, and non-color alternatives.

## Criteria

- Titles and summaries reflect active filters, time windows, and comparison context.
- Zero, missing, delayed, partial, stale, and unavailable data remain distinct.
- Dates, timezones, currency, percentages, precision, and large values are consistent.
- Dense labels, negative values, outliers, long series, empty ranges, and loading do not create misleading output.
- Interactive controls have accessible names, keyboard behavior, visible state, and reversible outcomes.
- Color is not the only series, threshold, selection, or status cue.
- Download or underlying tables appear only when product and data policy permit them.
- Rendering cost, large collections, and update frequency fit the product's runtime budget.

Use [assets/operational-dashboard-review.md](assets/operational-dashboard-review.md) and [assets/human-review-checklist.md](assets/human-review-checklist.md).

## Limits

- Do not select a chart because it is fashionable or available in a library.
- Do not infer causation from correlation or precision from decorative animation.
- Do not add a new chart library when the installed one satisfies the contract.
- Do not expose restricted raw data or enable exports without product policy.

## Quality gate

- [ ] Every visualization traces to a real analytical question and data shape.
- [ ] Metrics include units, windows, baselines, freshness, and provenance.
- [ ] Zero, missing, partial, delayed, stale, unavailable, and error states remain distinguishable.
- [ ] Exact-value, accessible-summary, keyboard, color-independent, and edge-data behavior is defined.
- [ ] Library and rendering-cost decisions use repository evidence.
- [ ] The human review checklist has no unresolved blocked item.
