# The Knowledge Cartographer - Historical Simulated Solution

This preserved JavaScript application reads and analyzes knowledge data that could have been produced by external tools. It does **not** implement an MCP client or server and must not be treated as a reference MCP architecture.

## What This Demonstrates

This solution demonstrates one historical file-based simulation:

- **MCP Tools Do The Work**: FireCrawl scrapes web content, File System MCP organizes files
- **Your Application Reads Results**: Focus on analyzing the data MCP tools already created  
- **Clean Separation**: MCP handles external operations, your app provides domain logic
- **Proper Data Flow**: MCP → Files → Your Application (not MCP → Your Application)

## Features

🔍 **Knowledge Base Reader**
- Reads structured data files created by MCP tools
- Loads entities, relationships, and source information
- Supports multiple knowledge domains/topics

🕸️ **Knowledge Graph Analysis**  
- Analyzes relationships between entities
- Identifies connection patterns and strengths
- Explores concept clusters and associations

📚 **Archive Management**
- Detects existing knowledge archives
- Lists available topics and domains
- Loads specific knowledge areas on demand

🎮 **Interactive Exploration CLI**
- Browse knowledge domains interactively
- Find entity connections and relationships
- Explore source materials and metadata

## Usage

### Explore Existing Knowledge Archives
```bash
# Load and explore a specific knowledge domain
node The-Knowledge-Cartographer-Agent-MCP.js "quantum computing"
node The-Knowledge-Cartographer-Agent-MCP.js "artificial intelligence"
```

### Interactive Archive Exploration
```bash
# Enter interactive exploration mode
node The-Knowledge-Cartographer-Agent-MCP.js --interactive
```

### Interactive Commands
```
> list                           # Show all available knowledge domains
> load quantum computing         # Load a specific knowledge domain
> overview                       # Show current topic overview
> find "quantum bit"             # Find connections for an entity
> relationships                  # Explore knowledge graph relationships
> sources                        # Show original source materials
> entities                       # List all entities in current topic
> help                           # Show available commands
> exit                           # Exit the system
```

## File Structure Expected

The application expects to find knowledge archives created by MCP tools:

```
akashic-archives-demo/               # Created by File System MCP
├── topics/
│   └── quantum-computing/
│       ├── entities.json            # Entities extracted by FireCrawl MCP
│       ├── relationships.json       # Relationships identified by Agent Mode
│       └── sources.json             # Original sources scraped by FireCrawl MCP
└── indexes/
    └── quantum-computing-index.json # Topic metadata organized by File System MCP
```

**In Real Usage:** GitHub Copilot Agent Mode would have already used MCP tools to create these files before your application runs.

## How This Relates to MCP + Agent Mode

This implementation illustrates a simulated file-oriented workflow, not a live MCP integration:

### Real Usage Flow:
1. **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode** → Uses **FireCrawl MCP Server** → Scrapes real web content
2. **Agent Mode** → Passes scraped data to **Your Application** → Processes knowledge
3. **Your Application** → Requests file operations via **Agent Mode** → **File System MCP** saves files
4. **Your Application** → Focuses purely on business logic (graphs, analysis, CLI)

### What Each Component Does:
- **FireCrawl MCP**: Web scraping, JavaScript rendering, batch processing
- **File System MCP**: File/directory operations, structured storage  
- **Agent Mode**: Orchestrates MCP tools and coordinates with your application
- **Your Application**: Knowledge extraction, graph construction, user interface

## Key Learning Points

🔧 **Historical architecture discussion**
- **Separation of Concerns**: MCP tools handle external operations, your app handles business logic
- **Data Flow**: MCP → Agent Mode → Your Application (not MCP → Your Application)
- **Agent Mode Orchestration**: Agent Mode coordinates between multiple MCP tools and your application

🧠 **Application Responsibilities**  
- Process data provided by MCP tools (don't duplicate MCP functionality)
- Focus on domain-specific logic (knowledge graphs, entity extraction, analysis)
- Provide user interfaces and interaction patterns

📊 **MCP Tool Responsibilities**
- **FireCrawl MCP**: Web scraping, content extraction, JavaScript rendering
- **File System MCP**: File operations, directory management, data persistence
- **Agent Mode**: Tool coordination, data passing, error handling
